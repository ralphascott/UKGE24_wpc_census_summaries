# UKGE24_wpc_census_summaries

Data and replication code to produce constituency-level Census summaries for the new 2024 Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies.

Measures are derived from available Census tables based on those used previously in the 2019 BES constituency results file (with some hopefully helpful additions for Scotland and Wales): https://www.doi.org/10.48420/20278599

For England and Wales, these are drawn from the Nomis API where possible, and where not from the ONS custom dataset tool: https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/create

For Scotland (for which there are currently limited measures), these are taken from the Scotland's Census website's custom dataset tool: https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/search-the-census#/location/topics
