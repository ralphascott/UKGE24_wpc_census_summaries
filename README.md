# UKGE24_wpc_census_summaries

This repo contains constituency-level Census summaries for all of the 632 new 2024 Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies in Great Britain, as well as the data and replication code used to produce them.

Measures are derived from available Census tables based on those used previously in the 2019 BES constituency results file (with some hopefully helpful additions for Scotland and Wales): https://www.doi.org/10.48420/20278599

For England and Wales, these are drawn from the Nomis API where possible, and where not, from the ONS custom dataset tool: https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/create

For Scotland (for which there are currently limited measures), these are taken from the Scotland's Census website's custom dataset tool: https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/search-the-census#/location/topics

The file also integrates the notional 2019 General Election results for the new boundaries produced by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher: https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/news/nol/shared/spl/xls_spreadsheets/results_spreadsheet.ods

And the notional 2016 EU referendum results for the new boundaries produced by Chris Hanretty: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtph-ml7CYVoeEUIc1g_IbOvbiZMa_ezRGQlHQoCpF4/edit?gid=341382343#gid=341382343
